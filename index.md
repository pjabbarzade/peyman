## About Me
  I'm a third-year Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, College Park, under the supervision of [Prof. Hajiaghayi](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~hajiagha/). I earned my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, where I was advised by [Prof. Abam](https://sharif.edu/~abam/).

  I am currently a member of the Theoretical Computer Science group at UMD, where my research interests primarily focus on designing algorithms, particularly for complex graph theory problems. My favorite project revolves around the design of an algorithm for the prize-collecting Steiner forest problem. Additionally, I am interested in optimizing submodular functions, which have wide applications in machine learning.

## Research Interests

- **Optimization:** submodular maximization, scheduling
- **Algorithmic Graph Theory:** steiner tree, steiner forest, k-mst

## News

- **[Aug 2024]** I am going to defend [my proposal](./assets/files/proposal.pdf) to advance to Ph.D. candidacy.
- **[Jun 2024]** Our paper on a dynamic algorithm for weighted submodular cover has been accepted for an oral presentation at [ICML 2024](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2024) in Vienna, Austria.
- **[Jan 2024]** I gave a presentation on our paper about the 2-approximation algorithm for the prize-collecting Steiner forest at [SODA 2024](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/soda24) in Alexandria, US.
- **[Dec 2023]** I presented a poster on dynamic matroid submodular maximization at [NeurIPS 2023](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023) in New Orleans, US.
